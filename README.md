# Sentiment Analysis using RNN on IMDb Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The RNN model was built using TensorFlow to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

## Key Features:
- Preprocessing and tokenizing IMDb review data
- Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers
- Trained the model using TensorFlow and Keras libraries
- Evaluated the model's performance on test data
- Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification

## Technologies:
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**

## Dataset:
- The project uses the IMDb movie reviews dataset which can be accessed [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Installation

- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deeplearning-rnn.git
